The MMC5983MA is a highly sensitive triple axis magnetometer by MEMSIC. It is capable of sensing down to 0.4mG enabling a heading accuracy of ±0.5°. Output rates of 1000Hz, ±8G FSR, and 18-bit resolution make the MMC5983MA a phenomenal magnetic sensor for electronic compass applications.

Saturation is a problem for all mag sensors. The MMC5983MA has special built-in degaussing circuitry to clear any residual magnetization.

We've got a feature complete Arduino library supporting I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI. Just search **SparkFun MMA5983MA** in the library manager and get measuring within minutes.
